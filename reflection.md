Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
My class represents a superhero! The superhero is able to grow,shrink, fly, and more!
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I decided to not implement any other methods. Although I did use import random, to create a random number which would then decide what response the examine() method gave.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
What worked was setting up all the methods, it was simple and easy to do. I really enjoyed adding more to each method, such as if statements and an inventory. What didn't work was trying to do the undo method. Advice I would give is to use an ArrayList to do the undo() method, as it can keep track of all the actions done.
